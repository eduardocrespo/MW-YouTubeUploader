INSTALLATION

1. Change the $wgYTU_User, $wgYTU_Password, and $wgYTU_APIKey in YouTubeUploader.php.

2. Add to LocalSettings.php
require_once('extensions/YouTubeUploader/YouTubeUploader.php');

3. Create this table in database:
CREATE TABLE `ytu_log` (
		`ytu_id` VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
		`ytu_user` INT,
		`ytu_timestamp` CHAR(14),
		`ytu_title` text,
		`ytu_link` text
		);

4. The file 'includes/categories.cat' needs to be writeable by the Apache user. This file has YouTube category information in it and serves as a fallback in case we can't get the category information directly from YouTube.

DEPENDENCIES

Requires the SimpleXML parser, this should be built in to most PHP distributions. On CentOS, need to install the package 'php-xml'.
